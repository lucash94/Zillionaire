### Data privacy
### Collected data
The Zillionaire App can only be installed via the Apple App Store. All data collected and stored within the Store is in responsible of the store provider.
In the Zillionaire App only the data entered by the user (e.g. expenses, stock data) and related meta data (e.g. timestamps) is stored. There is no storage or tracking of the user itself or the usage of the App.
All data is stored on the device itself and in the personal iCloud of the user. In case no iCloud storage is needed this option can be disabled within the privacy setting of the device.

### App authorizations
File access: Required to save exported data or load data that the user wants to import.

Photo access: Required to load photos from the devices photo library in order to attach and store it within an element in the app.

FaceID / TouchID: Required to lock the app. This is only a visual protection. There is no seperate encryption of the stored data implemented.

Internet access & iCloud: Required to store the entered data within the users iCloud. Optionally, current stock price information can be fetched via the internet. This needs to be activated by the user within the depot element.

### Retrieve current stock prices
By default no requests are sent to any third party. In case the option 'Fetch live stock price' is selected within one depot element, the current stock prices will be fetched from Yahoo Finances. This is done based on the ticker symbol entered by the user. The fetched prices are used to calculate the current value of the element. As those data is provided by a third party application Zillionaire does not take over any liability for the correctness and up-to-dateness of the retrieved and displayed data.

### Deletion of data
Saved data can be deleted via the option 'Delete data' within the app or via the devices settings.
Warning: The deletion of data cannot be undone.
